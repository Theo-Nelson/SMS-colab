# Single-Molecule Sequencing: Training, Methods, and Applications

## Overview
Sequencing-based research has become the dominant investigative practice within the biological sciences. This repository, "Single-molecule sequencing: training, methods, and applications," provides a comprehensive, hands-on, and in-depth introduction to sequencing technologies for students. Covering techniques from Sanger to third-generation technologies, this course alternates between lectures and labs, introducing students to the fundamental principles of DNA and RNA science. It progresses through cutting-edge library preparation and sequencing analysis techniques using Illumina and Nanopore technologies. Participants will perform direct-RNA sequencing on research samples and explore the ethical implications of data handling. The course also integrates relevant concepts in biology and computer science.
