# Single-Molecule & Spatial Sequencing: Methods & Applications

## Overview
Sequencing-based research has become the dominant investigative practice within the biological sciences. Single-Molecule & Spatial Sequencing: Methods & Applications, responds to this development by providing a hands-on and in-depth introduction to sequencing for first year PhD and MD-PhD students, from Sanger to third-generation technologies. Utilizing an alternating lecture-lab schedule, students are introduced to fundamental basic principles of DNA & RNA science, progressing to cutting-edge library preparation and sequencing analysis techniques with Illumina and Nanopore technologies. Students will have the opportunity to perform direct-RNA sequencing samples on research samples, and experience first-hand the ethical implications of this data. Relevant concepts in biology and computer science will be addressed.
